# HAT

HAT brings you the experience of old NES games to your TV!
The application was built using [Metrological Framework][metrological] and [Pixi.js][pixi]

It was built during the [UPC â€“ The Challenge][hackaton] hackathon.

## How to build it

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `webpack`.
3. Use the project folder as an app within the [Metrological] simulator.

## How it works

Bring your friends and use your phones as gamepads to play a sequence of 5 fast paced multiplayer games. On Android, the gamepad will also have haptic feedback.
Two game types are currently implemented: the classic Tron light bikes game and a 2-lane obstacle avoidance game.
