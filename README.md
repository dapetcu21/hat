# HAT

HAT brings you the experience of old NES games to your TV!

This was built during the [UPC – The Challenge][hackaton] hackathon using [Metrological Framework][metrological] and [Pixi.js][pixi].

## How to build it

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `UNFUCK=1 npm run build`.
3. Use the project folder as an app within the [Metrological SDK Simulator][simulator].

## How it works

Bring your friends and use your phones as gamepads to play a sequence of 5 fast paced multiplayer games. On Android, the gamepad will also have haptic feedback.

Two game types are currently implemented: the classic Tron light bikes game and a 2-lane obstacle avoidance game.
